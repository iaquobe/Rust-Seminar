= Introduction
<introduction>
In recent years the programming language Rust has been hard not to
notice. Whether on StackOverflow surveys, where it has been the most
loved language 9 years in a row @stackoverflowTechnology2024, 
in the Linux Kernel, as the first
language next to C and Assembler accepted into the codebase by Linus
Torvalds @kernelRustx2014, or on Github, where Rusts loyal fan-base seemingly rewrites
every existing project with Rust @zaisteRewrittenRust. 
The language appears to be everywhere.

While the popularity surrounding the language might be a good indicator,
that Rust must make some very smart design decisions, for an outsider it
might be difficult to see past the popularity and understand the reasons
behind this love.

Rust has a few aspects that make it a great choice. It is a high
performance language, whose runtime performance is on par with C/C++.
Unlike C/C++ whose 40+ year legacy makes them cumbersome to use at
times, Rust is a modern language with a streamlined experience.
It incorporates functional paradigms and iterators that
provide powerful functions such as `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.
It also comes packaged with build tools, a test framework, and a package
manager to allow for an expanding ecosystem similar to Pythons pip.
But Rust does not just combine the best aspects of existing languages,
with itâ€™s typing system it places a strong emphasis on memory safety and
security. And it is those aspects which make Rust really stand out from
other languages. 

In this document we will introduce the key ideas of
Rust memory management and error handling. With it, we hope to make the
hype around Rust understandable. We also hope to show that writing safe
and performant code can be a lot of fun.

#pagebreak()
= Memory Management
<memory-management>
In a running program, all class instances and variables need to be saved
somewhere. In general there are two locations where programs save their
data: The stack and the heap.


#terms(
  terms.item("The stack", [
    usually contains variables local to a function and variables with a
    known size. By design the stack manages its memory automatically,
    meaning when calling a function, the function reserves as much space as
    it needs, and when the function returns, the space is
    automatically freed.]),
  terms.item("The heap", [
    on the other-hand contains global variables, and variables whose size is
    not known at compile time. In contrast to the stack, memory on the heap
    is not managed automatically. This means, that something needs to manage
    memory. Depending on the language, different entities are responsible
    for managing the heap. In most languages memory is either managed by the
    programmer \(manual) or by the language runtime \(garbage collector).])
)


== Manual Memory Management
<manual-memory-management>
The most popular languages to use manual memory management today are C
and C++. In Manual memory management the programmer is responsible for
managing heap data. When they want to create a new variable on the heap,
they need to ask the operating system for some memory. When they are
done with the variable, they need to tell the system that they no longer
need it. How memory is allocated depends on the language, in C for
instance it is done with the `malloc()` and `free()` functions provided 
by the standard C library:

```c
// Ask for enough memory to store DataType
DataType* data = malloc(sizeof(DataType)); 

// data no longer needed, ask to free data again
free(data); 
```

With this power however, comes responsibility. Every `malloc()` needs
exactly one matching `free()` call.
At first this sounds very simple,
but when introducing loops, if statements, nested function calls, 
and multiple pointers to the same data it becomes very difficult 
to perfectly match mallocs/frees for each variable.
Mismanaging manual memory falls into the three following types of problem. 


#pagebreak()
==== Memory Leak
<memory-leak>
happens when the memory is not freed and the memory stays reserved. Over time
a memory leak uses more and more space on the heap, leading to worse
performance, and potentially even crashing the program or the system.

```c
// memory leak
DataType* data = malloc(sizeof(DataType)); 
```

==== Use After Free
<use-after-free>
happens when the data is accessed after it is freed. This leads to undefined
behavior, as it is possible that the operating system already reserved
this space for some other variable.

```c
// use after free
DataType* data = malloc(sizeof(DataType)); 
free(data); 
*data->member = 1;
```


==== Double Free
<double-free>
happens when the same data is freed multiple times. This again leads to
undefined behavior.

```c
// double free
DataType* data = malloc(sizeof(DataType)); 
free(data);
free(data);
```


== Garbage Collector
<garbage-collector>
To avoid the pitfalls of manual memory management most languages \(Java,
Python, JS, etc.) opt for a garbage collector. A garbage collector
automates memory management at the cost of performance. When the
programmer creates a variable which needs to be saved on heap, the
programming language environment keeps track of it. In regular intervals
a routine scans heap variables and checks if there
are still active references in the program pointing towards this data.
If nothing points to this data, it is freed. The benefit is that it is
easier for the programmer, but the drawback is that the routine reduces
the runtime performance. When measuring performance the garbage
collector can be identified in spikes of CPU and Memory as seen in
@cpu-garbage-collector.

#figure(
  image("./images/cpu-usage-spikes-maybe-during-Go-Garbage-collection.png"),
  caption: [CPU usage spikes due to garbage collector. 
        The CPU usage is low most of the time, 
        there are however spikes at regular intervals. 
        Those are caused by the garbage collector, 
        which needs to go through the entire program memory checking for unused data
        #cite(<source-garbage-collector>)
      ],
) <cpu-garbage-collector>


== Ownership
<ownership>
Rust takes a third approach, that is not revolutionary per se. Modern
C++ already implements this way of managing memory in what is called
Resource Acquisition is Initialization. The difference though, is that
in C++ it is added to an existing language, while in Rust it is deeply
integrated into the language.

In Rust this approach is called Ownership, and the idea is that neither
the programming language environment nor the programmer need to manage
memory. Instead, memory is managed by the data structures themselves.
This is achieved with the following rules:

+ Each value in Rust has an owner
+ There can only be one owner at a time
+ When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped

The following code snippet shows a very simple example of ownership,
scope, and drop. The memory layout for this snippet can be seen in
figure @string-pointer.

```rust
fn main() {
    // create a string with content "hello" saved on the heap
    let s1 = String::from("hello") 
    // s1 is owner of heap data: "hello" 

}   // s1 goes out of scope: heap data "hello" is dropped
```

#figure(
  image("./images/string-pointer.svg", width: 35%),
  caption: [s1 is saved on the stack.
    It contains string metadata (length, capacity) and a pointer to the string data.
    This string data is saved on the heap.
    When s1 does out of scope, it drops (frees) the data on the heap.
    @rustlangRustProgramming
  ],
)<string-pointer>

With only one variable ownership is quite straightforward. 
The following code snippet however, shows how ownership can
become significantly more complex with just one more variable.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello"); 
    // s1 is owner of heap value

    let s2 = s1; 
    // who owns the heap value now? 
}
```

Who owns the heap data containing "hello" now? And how does the memory
layout look like? 
There are three possibilities how a language could handle such a case:

==== Shallow Copy
<shallow-copy>
A shallow copy would copy the data on the stack \(string metadata). It
would also copy the pointer to the heap data to point to the same
location (see @fig-shallow-copy).
As mentioned in Rust a value can only have one owner,
in this case however there would be two. 
This snippet also highlights why multiple owners are not allowed in Rust. 
When `s1` goes out of scope, it drops its value. When `s2` goes out of
scope, then the value would already be dropped. Dropping it again would
lead to a double free.

==== Deep Copy
<deep-copy>
Another way to handle this situation would be a deep copy. With a deep
copy, it would not only copy stack data, but also heap data 
(see @fig-deep-copy).
With this approach there is no problem with Rusts ownership rules, as
there is only one owner for both values. The problem with this approach
starts during runtime. Depending on the data structure a deep copy
might need a long time and take up a lot of memory.
Imagine a string containing the content of an entire book, 
deep copying this string might take around a megabyte per copy. 
Of course there are situations where a deep copy is desired, 
but defaulting to it would be devastating for memory efficiency 
and runtime performance. 
Thus Rust allows for explicit deep copies,
but does not perform deep copies implicitly. 


#grid(
  columns: 2,
  gutter: 5pt,
  align: alignment.bottom,
  grid.cell([
    #figure(image("./images/double-pointer.svg", width: 80% ), 
      caption: [
        Shallow Copy: only data on the stack is copied (string metadata). 
        the pointer to the heap value would still point to the same location.

        (strring content) would be copied.
        @rustlangRustProgramming
    ])<fig-deep-copy>]),
)

==== Move
<move>
Because a shallow copy does not comply with Rusts rule that there can
only be one owner, and because a deep copy would severely impact
performance, Rust defaults to moving values. In a move, there is no
copying, and the ownership of the value is passed to the new variable.
The memory layout can be seen in @move-layout.
During a move, the original variable looses ownership of the value, 
this invalidates the variable.
Using the variable after a move would cause a compile time error.

#figure(
    image("./images/invalidate-data.svg", width: 35%),
    caption: [Move: s1 moves its ownership of "hello" to s2,
            becoming an invalid variable in the process. 
            A compile error would occur when attempting to use s2 
            after moving ownership.
            @rustlangRustProgramming
          ]
)<move-layout>


=== Borrowing
<borrowing>
One thing to note, is that passing variables as parameters implicitly
performs a move \(see @lst-implicit-move). To mitigate this, one could write
functions, which also return ownership. This can be done by returning a
tuple containing the return value, and the ownership as 
\(see @lst-manual-borrow).
Since this is a very common use case, Rust has a dedicated syntax for
this. Rather than passing the value, only a reference is passed. This is
called borrowing \(see @lst-borrowing).


#figure(
  caption: [Implicit move of function parameters.
    Variable cannot be used after function call because of the move.],
```rust
fn compute_length(s: String) -> usize {
    // returns the length of a string
    return s.len(); 
}

fn main() {
    // s is owner of value "hello"
    let s = String::from("hello"); 

    // ownership of "hello" passed to get_string_length
    let len = compute_length(s);

    // Compile Error: 
    // s is not valid anymore as its value has been moved
    let len2 = s.len();
}
```)<lst-implicit-move>

#figure(
  caption: [Returning ownership after a function returns.
       This makes it possible to use the variable after it has been used as parameter. 
    ],
```rust
fn compute_length(s: String) -> (usize, String) {
    // return length of string and ownership of string
    return (s.len(), s); 
}

fn main() {
    // s is owner of value "hello"
    let s = String::from("hello"); 

    // ownership of "hello" passed to get_string_length
    let (len,s) = compute_length(s);

    // now this is possible because get_string_length 
    // returned ownership to s
    let len2 = s.len();
}
```)<lst-manual-borrow>

#figure(
  caption: [Borrowing is a shorter syntax to return ownership to a 
    variable after a function has returned],
```rust
fn compute_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    return s.len();
}

fn main(){
    // s is owner of value "hello"
    let s1 = String::from("hello"); 

    // value of s only borrowed to function
    let len = compute_length(&s1); 

    // after get_string_length returns it also returns ownership of value
    let len2 = s.len();
}
```)<lst-borrowing>

=== References
<references>
Borrowing works over references (see @lst-references).
The memory layout for such references can be seen in figure @references-layout.
Using references eliminates double frees, as references never drop values. 
With references however, use after frees could be possible, when the variable 
goes out of scope, while a reference to it is still in scope.

// To keep within the scope of a short Rust introduction, 
// we will not discuss them further here, but there are great
// resources in the Rust book explaining lifetimes @rustlangLifetimesRust. 

#figure(
  caption: [Create references to a value],
```rust
fn main() {
    // s1 is owner of value
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    // s is a reference to s1
    let s = &s1;
}
```)<lst-references>

#figure(
    image("./images/references.svg", width: 50%),
    caption: [Reference: when s goes out of scope,
            the value is not dropped as s is not the owner. 
            When s1 goes out of scope the value is dropped and s becomes invalid
            @rustlangRustProgramming
          ]
)<references-layout>


==== Lifetimes
Rust is able to eliminate use after free errors with a feature called lifetimes. 
With Rust lifetimes, it is possible to bind the lifetime of two variables together 
to guarantee that a reference never lives longer than the value it is referencing. 
The syntax for lifetimes can be seen in @lifetimes,
which is unique to Rust may thus take some time to get familiar with it. 
In the most common use cases the compiler is able to deduce lifetimes automaticall 
(see @lifetimes).

#figure(
  caption: [Lifetimes in Rust; `'a` indicates the lifetime of a variable. 
    both the parameter `s` and the return value have this lifetime, 
    guaranteeing that the returned reference will only be valid as long as `s` 
    is valid. 
    This code serves only as example, for this function lifetime annotations 
    are not required, as the compiler is able to deduce them automatically.
  ],
```rust 
// both following functions are equivalent:
// with lifetime annotation
fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    &s[0..1]
}

// without lifetime annotation
fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
    &s[0..1]
}
```)<lifetimes>

There are cases however, where the compiler is not able to deduce 
the lifetimes automatically. 
Functions with multiple references (@lifetime-3) 
and Datastructures (@lifetime-2) for instance. 

#figure(
  caption: [
    This function does not compile without lifetime annotation, 
    as the Rust compiler does not know whether the return value needs to live
    as long as `x`, or `y`.
  ],
```rust 
// does not compile, needs annotation 
fn first(x: &i32, y: &i32) -> &i32 {
  x
}
```)<lifetime-3>

#figure(
  caption: [
    DataType instances have two `i32` references.
    The lifetimes are needed so that the compiler knows, 
    that both the references `x` and the reference `y` need
    to live longer than the instance that is referencing them. 
  ],
```rust 
// references x and y need to live longer than instance of DataType
struct DataType<'a> {
    x: &'a i32,
    y: &'a i32,
}
```)<lifetime-2>



=== Further Guaranties 
<guaranties>
As shown in the previous sections Rust is able to eliminate the three 
issues with manual memory management: memory leak, double free, and use after free. 
However, it is also providing far more memory guaranties than this. 
To highlight the power of Rusts memory guaranties we will first introduce mutability. 

==== Mutability
<mutability>
In Rust all variables are immutable by default. To change variables, they need
to be explicitly set as mutable \(see @lst-var-mutability). The same goes for
References \(see @lst-ref-mutability ). 
It is possible to have as many immutable references to a variable in Rust, 
however, if there is one mutable reference to a variable,
this becomes the only valid reference to it (see @lst-ref-mutability-2).

#figure(
  caption: [Variables are immutable by default and can explicitly be set as mutable],
```rust
// keyword mut specifies that the string value of s can be changed
let mut s = String::from("hello");

// changing the string data is only possible because s is mutable
s.clear();
```)<lst-var-mutability>

#figure(
  caption: [References are immutable by default and can explicitly be set as mutable],
```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

// borrowing s as a mutable reference
let s1 = &mut s;

// changing the string data only possible because both the string, 
// and the reference are mutable
s1.clear();
```)<lst-ref-mutability>

#figure(
  caption: [If there is a mutable reference it needs to be the only reference],
```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &s;
let r2 = &mut s;

// compile error: r1 immutable reference and r2 mutable reference
// if r2 is a mutable reference it has to be the only reference
println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);
```)<lst-ref-mutability-2>

Because there can only be one mutable reference at a time, this
guarantees that references in Rust always point to valid data. In other
languages where multiple references to the same value are allowed,
access to invalid data can happen when one reference modifies the data
in such a way that other references now point to invalid data. Those
errors are especially hard to debug, as they might not always cause
faulty behavior (see @lst-cpp-ref). In Rust such a usage invalidates
previous references, leading to an error at compile time, rather than a
runtime error (see @lst-ref-mutability-3).

#figure(
  caption: [C++: multiple mutable references causing invalid data access],
```cpp
int main() {
    std::string str = "Hello";

    // Get a pointer to string data
    const char* ptr = str.c_str(); 

    // Invalidate the pointer by clearing the string
    str.append(" World");
    // code compiles without any issues
    // BUT: using ptr after this line is undefined behavior

    // depending on capacity of str, ptr may still be valid.
    // if capacity large enough for " World"    -> ptr still valid
    // otherwise string moved to a new location -> ptr invalid
}
```)<lst-cpp-ref>

#figure(
  caption: [Security guarantees from limiting mutable references],
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello world");

    // immutable reference to the first 5 characters of string s 
    let word = &s[..5]; 

    // mutably borrows s to clear content
    s.clear();         

    // compile error:
    // word has become invalid, as it is an immutable reference to s
    // s.clear() mutably borrowed s invalidating other references
    println!("First word: {}", word);

}
```)<lst-ref-mutability-3>

#pagebreak()
= Error Handling
<error-handling>
Error Handling, besides memory safety, is another standout feature of
Rust. To understand Rusts approach, it is important to know that there
are three types of errors that can occur when programming. Depending on
the type, they might be easier or harder to detect and fix. The types of
errors are:

#terms(
  terms.item("Logic Error:", [
      Those happen in the brain of the programmer They occur when the problem 
      statement is either misunderstood, or poorly communicated. These may be
      the hardest errors to detect, as they compile and run without any
      obvious failure, except for a wrong result. While the syntax of a
      language can help reduce those errors, this effect is rather subjective.
  ]),
  terms.item("Compilation Errors:", [
  Those occur when attempting to compile bad code. The Language detects
  syntax errors or other instances with incorrect usage \(such as calling
  a non-existent class method, using wrong parameters, â€¦). Those errors
  are easiest to detect, as the language detects them for the programmer.
  ]),
  terms.item("Runtime Errors:", [
    Occur during program execution. Those errors are hard to detect, as the
    language does not detect them. Additionally, they might not necessarily
    occur on each program execution. There is a multitude of runtime errors,
    among the most common ones are:
    + Accessing invalid data \(e.g.~array out-of-bound, accessing
      nullpointers)
    + Calling a function that can fails \(e.g.~opening a nonexistent file)
    + performing invalid arithmetic \(e.g.~division by zero)
  ])
)



In this chapter we will describe how Rust helps with error handling, by
turning runtime errors into compile time errors. Before moving to Rust,
we will quickly highlight how other languages help programmers to avoid
runtime errors, using the three common runtime errors \(invalid data
access, failing function calls, and invalid arithmetic) and C++ and Java
as examples.

#pagebreak()
== Error Handling in C
<error-handling-in-c>
In C error handling is done by the programmer. There is little help, and
programs can fail in multiple ways. Often, the language does not warn or
fail to compile. The following snippets show how C fails to support
programmers handling our example runtime errors, even in the simplest of
cases:

==== Accessing invalid data
<accessing-invalid-data>
By default, C does not help prevent access to invalid data. Some
compilers have flags to protect against buffer overflow
\(e.g.~`-fstack-protector` for `gcc`) to protect against attack writing
into invalid data, but this is not on by default.

```c
int[2] arr = [1,2];
int el = arr[2];
// undefine behavior from here on out
```

==== Calling a function that fails
<calling-a-function-that-fails>
Detecting a failed function call is not uniform in C. Some functions
return `NULL` on failure \(like `fopen()`), others return `0` on success
\(like `system()`), some set a global `errno` for extra info, and some
encode the error in the return value itself. The programmer is
responsible for reading how each function might fail.

```c
char* path = 'file/does/not/exist';
FILE* f = fopen(path); 
// undefine behavior from here on out
```

==== Performing invalid arithmetic
<performing-invalid-arithmetic>
Division by zero is undefined behavior in C. The programmer is
responsible for checking that the divisor is not zero.

```c
int a = 1;
int b = 0;
int c = a / b;
// undefine behavior from here on out
```

== Error Handling in Java
<error-handling-in-java>
In stark Contrast to C, Java helps programmers handling errors and
provides a dedicated syntax and data type: Exceptions. Exceptions can be
thrown in any part of the program. There two types of exceptions:
checked exceptions, which need to be checked at compile time, and
unchecked exceptions, which donâ€™t need to be checked to successfully
compile. With our example runtime errors, the following exceptions would
be thrown:

+ accessing an array out of bounds throws an
  `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`
+ opening a nonexistent file throws a `FileNotFoundException`
+ dividing by zero throws an `ArithmeticException`

While much more helpful than C, Javas syntax still lacks in a few
aspects:
+ All variables can be `nullpointers`, thus every variable needs to be
  checked
+ The syntax is cumbersome, and it is tempting to write empty
  `try/catch` blocks

== Error Handling in Rust
<error-handling-in-rust>
Rust, similar to Java, helps developers to handle errors in a cleanly.
But it does go further than Java, as almost all runtime errors are moved
to compile time errors. Furthermore, itâ€™s typing system eliminates
common pain points with Javas error handling. Before getting into our
three runtime error examples, and how Rust deals with them, it is
important to quickly introduce the `panic!()` function. Calling this
function immediately exists the program safely. This is used in the case
of unrecoverable errors.

=== Invalid Data Access
<invalid-data-access>
Part of how Rust helps with invalid data access was already discussed in
the memory management chapter. In Rust, references always point to valid
data. This is due to the restriction on mutable references. There are
however also other scenarios which attempt to access invalid data,
reading beyond the length of an array for instance. To exemplify why
Rusts approach is so special however, we will discuss Rusts approach
with one of the most common invalid data problems: null pointers.

In some scenarios it makes sense to have a special value to represent
the absence of an object. For instance, a data structure containing
information on a person might contain the field `home_phone_number`.
Some people however donâ€™t have a phone at home. In this case it would
make perfect sense to dedicate a special value, to specify that the
person has no phone. Most other languages use `null` for this
\(C/C++/Java/â€¦). The problem though, is that in those languages
everything or next to everything can be `null`. In Java all possible
variables, while in C/C++ all pointers can be `null`. Because all values
can theoretically be `null`, but most practically canâ€™t, those languages
usually donâ€™t enforce null checks, as it would be too much boilerplate
code. In C/C++/Java you can access methods of a pointer/reference
without first checking that this reference is valid.

In Rust on the other hand, no value can be empty unless explicitly
allowed. With this approach only values that have a realistic chance of
being empty can be empty. As such Rust forces the programmer to check
for emptiness before accessing values. This is achieved with Enums,
specifically with the Option Enum. Enums are structures in Rust, which
can be in one of multiple named states \(Variant). The Option Enum for
instance can either contain a value `Some(value)` or be empty `None`.


#pagebreak()
```rust
// Option of type T
// can either be empty value
// or a value of T
enum Option<T> {
    None, 
    Some(T),
}
```

To access data from an Enum, it needs to be unpacked into itâ€™s current
Variant \(see @lst-option-unpacking). Because Options are commonly used, Rust
implements methods to reduce boilerplate when working with Options 
(`unwrap()`, `unwrap_or_default()`, `expect()`. See @lst-option-method for usage).

#figure(
  caption: [Unpacking Option into different variants],
```rust
fn main() {
    // call function which returns optional string

          use cases and reduce boilerplate code])<lst-option-method>

Rust does not only use `Option<T>` to remove the need for
`NullpointerExceptions`, it also uses them for all other kinds of
invalid data. The hash-map method `find()`, the Vector method `get()`,
and the string method `find()` all return option types to indicate if
the requested data even exists.

=== Failing Function Calls
<failing-function-calls>
Handling failing function calls is quite similar to accessing invalid
data. However, with functions there is some additional complexity, as
there are multiple possible reasons for a function to fail. Opening a
file could fail because the file does not exist, or because the user
does not have read access. To accommodate for this, Rust implements
another enum `Result`. It is similar to `Option<T>` but allows for an
error type.

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```

The benefit over Option, is that the Error state can also carry
information. Similar to exceptions in Java, this information can tell
you why the function failed. Unlike Java though, there is no unchecked
exception, all results need to be extracted into either a result on
success, or an error on failure. Again Rust implements methods for
common use-cases such as `unwrap()`, `unwrap_or_default()`, `expect()`,
etc.

=== Invalid Arithmetic
<invalid-arithmetic>
The last runtime error consisted of invalid arithmetic. In contrast to
the other two errors Rust trades off some security against convenience,
for arithmetic operations. Just like in C and Java, it is possible to
perform any operation without checking for edge cases.

```rust
let a = 1; 
let b = 2; 

// overflow/underflow possible without warning
let c = a + b;
let d = a - b;
let e = a * b;
// this panics if b == 0 
let f = a / b;
```

However, while the default operations may cause a program to panic, Rust
provides a range of methods for cases, where security is needed. For
every arithmetic edge case Rust implements multiple wrappers. The
following table shows a subset of addition methods for the `u32` type:

#figure(
align(center)[#table(
  columns: 3,
  align: (col, row) => (auto,auto,auto,).at(col),
  inset: 6pt,
  [function], [return], [description],
  [`checked_add()`],
  [`Option<u32>`],
  [returns `None` on overflow],
  [`carrying_add()`],
  [`(u32, bool)`],
  [returns carry],
  [`overflowing_add()`],
  [`(u32, bool)`],
  [returns wrapped value + overflow bit],
  [`wrapping_add()`],
  [`u32`],
  [returns wrapped value],
  [`strict_add()`],
  [`u32`],
  [panics on overflow],
)]
)

= Conclusion
<conclusion>
Rust is able to provide many security guarantees, both in memory safety,
and in error handling. This is achieved for two reasons that work hand
in hand. On the one hand Rust requires that the programmer checks for
edge cases for everything that can go wrong. On the other hand Rusts
syntax is very explicit, greatly the reducing the number of lines where
something can go wrong \(variables and references are immutable by
default, empty values are not possible unless explicitly stated,
functions cannot fail unless explicitly set in the return type, etc.)

In combination this makes for a language with great security, but also
with great performance, as the compiler can make more assumptions during
optimization.
